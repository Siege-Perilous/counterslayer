#### Card trays

Added a new tray type for playing cards that support standard card sizes (Standard, Mini American, Mini European, Euro, Japanese, Tarot, and Square). Cards rest on a sloped floor for easy retrieval with a finger cutout. Custom card sizes can be defined and are shared globally across all trays.

#### Tray rotation for efficient bin packing

Trays can now be automatically rotated 90° to achieve more efficient packing within the box. The algorithm considers both orientations and picks the one that minimizes total box footprint. You can override the automatic rotation per-tray if needed, forcing a specific orientation. [#15](https://github.com/Siege-Perilous/counterslayer/pull/15)
