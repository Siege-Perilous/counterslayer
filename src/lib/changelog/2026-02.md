#### Major UI overhaul

Counter Slayer now uses the `@tableslayer/ui` component library, bringing a refreshed look and feel that's consistent with Table Slayer. The new pane-based layout includes a navigation menu and improved mobile support with drag and drop interactions. [#10](https://github.com/Siege-Perilous/counterslayer/pull/10) [#7](https://github.com/Siege-Perilous/counterslayer/pull/7) [#12](https://github.com/Siege-Perilous/counterslayer/pull/12)

#### Custom counter shapes

You can now define custom shapes beyond rectangles. Create counters based on hexagons, circles, and triangles with configurable corner radius for smoothing triangle points. Edge-loaded trays now properly form-fit these shapes. [#3](https://github.com/Siege-Perilous/counterslayer/pull/3) [#5](https://github.com/Siege-Perilous/counterslayer/pull/5)

#### Performance improvements

Geometry calculations now run in web workers, keeping the UI responsive while generating complex tray layouts. Geometry is also cached so you can navigate without triggering regeneration. [#10](https://github.com/Siege-Perilous/counterslayer/pull/10)

#### Print view

A new print view shows each box on its own print bed, making it easier to prepare files for 3D printing. Labels are now rendered directly on the tray previews. [#10](https://github.com/Siege-Perilous/counterslayer/pull/10)

#### Improved bin packing

Trays now utilize side-by-side packing when a custom box size is set, making better use of available space. [#9](https://github.com/Siege-Perilous/counterslayer/pull/9)
