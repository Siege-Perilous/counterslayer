# Content Slayer

Content Slayer is a small Svelte / JSCad application to help you build box and tray inserts for your war games. Code quality isn't so hot, as it was mostly vibe-coded with Claude.

## Contributing

Feel free to create a PR to contribute code changes or add a new game to the prebuilt trays. You can find these in [`static/projects`](https://github.com/Siege-Perilous/counterslayer/tree/main/static/projects).
